<H1>Monarch Butterflies</h1>
<img src="Monarch.jpg" alt="Monarch Butterfly">
<p> Meet the monarch butterfly, an American treasure. The monarch butterfly's scientific name is Danaus plexippus. Monarch butterflies can be recognized by their 
striking, orange,black, and white markings.Female monarch butterflies have thicker black markings and 
occasionally are a darker orange color than their male counterparts. The Monarch pictured above is most likely 
a female. Monarch butterflies are pollinators,which means the move pollen from plant to plant, assisting in the
 fertilization process. Another example of a pollinator is a honey bee, some small birds can act as pollinators as well!
 Without pollinators, we would have no fresh produce as well as much less biodiversity amongst plants, which is why it is important
to protect our butterfly friends. </p>
<H2>Migration</h2>
<p> Monarch butterflies are a very unique type of butterfly because they have an annual migration from Canada and North America all the way to Mexico, where it is warm and they can reproduce and survive the winter.Resaerchers say that Monarch 
butterflies are the only known butterfly to have a migration that is similar to bird migrations.Since monarch buteerflies have a fairly short life span, it takes a few generations 
to get all the way from North America to Mexico.However, it is amazing that the new generation of monarchs knows to migrate despite having never previously made the journey. Monarch 
butterflies use environmental cues to know when it is time to head south, unfortunately,in recent years, fewer monarchs have been migrating to changes in 
temperature due to global warming. While global warming is a very large issue to tackle that will take time, there are things people can do to help raise Monarch populations
as well as help them complete their journey, such as providing safe places for them to stop along the way.</p>

<h3> You, Me, and Milkweed</h3>
	<p> In recent years the monarch butterfly population has dropped drastiaclly due to increased use of pesticides and a lack of milkweed.
Once they hatch, monarch caterpillars can only eat milkweed,every other plnt or leaf is poisonous to them. In otherwords, if they eat anything else they will die. Milkweed is a part of the weed family and therefore is not immune 
to harmful pesticides and weed killers. Wihout milkweed, monarch butterflies cannot survive and reproduce, but we can help! By planting milkweed in our own backyards and public 
greenspaces, we are creating safe monarch habbitats and helping increase the population. Milkweed has beautiful orange and yellow flowers, and seeds, or full grown plants, can usually be found at your local gardening
store. Simply by planting more milkweed and not using harmful pesticides, we can make a big difference in conserving this beautiful species.	</p>
