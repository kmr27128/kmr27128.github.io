<H1>Monarch Butterflies</h1>
<img src="Monarch.jpg">
<p> Meet the monarch butterfly, an American treasure. The monarch butterfly's scientific name is Danaus plexippus. Monarch butterflies can be recognized by their 
striking, orange,black, and white markings.Female monarch butterflies have thicker black markings and 
occasionally are a darker orange color than their male counterparts. The Monarch pictured above is most likely 
a female. Monarch butterflies are pollinators,which means the move pollen from plant to plant, assisting in the
 fertilization process. Another example of a pollinator is a honey bee, some small birds can act as pollinators as well!
 Without pollinators, we would have no fresh produce as well as much less biodiversity amongst plants, which is why it is important
to protect our butterfly friends. </p>
<H2>Migration</h2>
<p> Monarch butterflies are a very unique type of butterfly because they have an annual migration from Canada and North America all the way to Mexico.Resaerchers say that Monarch 
butterflies are the only known butterfly to have a migration that is similar to bird migrations.Since monarch buteerflies have a fairly short life span, it takes a few generations 
to get all the way from North America to Mexico.However, it is amazing that the new generation of monarchs knows to migrate despite having never previously made the journey. Monarch 
butterflies use environmental cues to know when it is time to head south, unfortunately,in recent years, fewer monarchs have been migrating to changes in 
temperature due to global warming. While global warming is a very large issue to tackle that will take time, there are things people can do to help raise Monarch populations
as well as help them complete their journey.</p>
